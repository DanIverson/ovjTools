This directory contains the files needed to build Xrecon for Imaging_Sense

The original files are in /sw/LinuxTools/fftw, 

This directory contains the software for the fftw3.
It is used to build Xrecon, a standalone fft routine.
It is subject to the general GNU license.

fftw-3.1.2.tar.gz is the original file available from  http://www.fftw.org/
                  please use 'gunzip -c' to preserve the .gz file.

fftw-3.1.2        is the directory that holds the code, after gunzip -c 
                  and tar -xvf

Inside fftw-3.1.2, I executed the following command to create the 
libfftw3.a library:

prompt> ./configure
prompt> make
prompt> libtool --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c -s libfftw3.la `pwd`

Note the backquotes around pwd, it is the installation directory, it
needs to be a full path. This creates the library in the current directory. 
'make install' places it in /usr/local/lib.

The first two commands are quite verbose and take as much as a minute
on a Dell 370N. The third command takes about 15 seconds.

NB: to make a shared library version, replace ./configure with "./configure --enable=shared"
