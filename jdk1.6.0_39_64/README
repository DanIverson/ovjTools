The Java JDK is distributed under the Oracle Binary License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products and JavaFX 
and is intended to be used solely for the purposed of building OpenVnmrJ and/or running OpenVnmrJ.

A newer version of Java might work, but has not been tested. If you use a newer Java, and *tested* the resulting OpenVnmrJ,
please file an issue at:
